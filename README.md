# Shobee

Welcome to **Shobee**, a sample e-commerce site designed to showcase essential features for an online shopping experience. This project is built to demonstrate my skills in frontend development, e-commerce structure, and API integration.

## üõí Project Overview

Shobbee is a user-friendly e-commerce platform that allows users to browse through various products, add items to their cart, and simulate the online shopping process. This project leverages a third-party API for product data, providing a realistic context for product listings, categories, and cart management. Please note that the API data may change or be temporarily unavailable, which could affect the functionality of certain features.

## üìã Features

- **Product Browsing**: View a range of products with details like title, description, price, and category.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and view products in a cart with real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
- **API Integration**: Uses a REST API for product data, which dynamically populates the site‚Äôs content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Vuetify (UI Library)
- **Routing**: Vue Router for seamless navigation between pages
- **State Management**: Pinia for reactive, modular state management
- **API**: [Platzi Fake API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/swagger/) for realistic product data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Shobbee relies on the [Platzi Fake API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/swagger/), an open REST API that provides sample e-commerce data. Since the API's data may be modified, it could result in unexpected behavior or errors. For example, product categories or IDs may change, which could break certain features.
